# Inheritance

The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.

Syntax of Inheritance in C++:-

class  derived_class_name : access-specifier  base_class_name
{
       //    body ....
};

* Note: A derived class doesnâ€™t inherit access to private data members. However, it does inherit a full parent object, which contains any private members which that class declares.

## Types Of Inheritance in C++

The inheritance can be classified on the basis of the relationship between the derived class and the base class. In C++, we have 5 types of inheritances:

1. Single inheritance
2. Multilevel inheritance
3. Multiple inheritance
4. Hierarchical inheritance
5. Hybrid inheritance

* Single Inheritance -a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one base class is inherited by one derived class only.

Syntax:-

class subclass_name : access_mode base_class
{
  //  body of subclass
};

```c++
// C++ program to demonstrate how to implement the Single inheritance
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    Vehicle() { cout << "This is a Vehicle\n"; }
};

// sub class derived from a single base classes
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    Car() { cout << "This Vehicle is Car\n"; }
};

// main function
int main()
{
    // Creating object of sub class will
    // invoke the constructor of base classes
    Car obj;
    return 0;
}

//This is a Vehicle
//This Vehicle is Car
```

* Multiple Inheritance- a class can inherit from more than one class. i.e one subclass is inherited from more than one base class.

Syntax:-

class subclass_name : access_mode base_class1, access_mode base_class2, ....
{
  // body of subclass
};

```cpp
// C++ program to illustrate the multiple inheritance
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// first base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    Vehicle() { cout << "This is a Vehicle\n"; }
};

// second base class
class FourWheeler {
public:
    FourWheeler() { cout << "This is a 4 Wheeler\n"; }
};

// sub class derived from two base classes
class Car : public Vehicle, public FourWheeler {
  public:
    Car() { cout << "This 4 Wheeler Vehical is a Car\n"; }
};

// main function
int main()
{
    // Creating object of sub class will
    // invoke the constructor of base classes.
    Car obj;
    return 0;
}

// This is a Vehicle
// This is a 4 Wheeler
// This 4 Wheeler Vehical is a Car
```

* Multilevel Inheritance- derived class is created from another derived class and that derived class can be derived from a base class or any other derived class. There can be any number of levels.

Syntax:-

class derived_class1: access_specifier base_class
{
... .. ...
}
class derived_class2: access_specifier derived_class1
{
... .. ...
}
.....

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    Vehicle() { cout << "This is a Vehicle\n"; }
};

// first sub_class derived from class vehicle
class fourWheeler : public Vehicle {
public:
    fourWheeler() { cout << "4 Wheeler Vehicles\n"; }
};

// sub class derived from the derived base class fourWheeler
class Car : public fourWheeler {
public:
    Car() { cout << "This 4 Wheeler Vehical is a Car\n"; }
};

// main function
int main()
{
    // Creating object of sub class will
    // invoke the constructor of base classes.
    Car obj;
    return 0;

// This is a Vehicle
// 4 Wheeler Vehicles
// This 4 Wheeler Vehical is a Car
}
```

* Hierarchical Inheritance-more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class. i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.

Syntax:-

class derived_class1: access_specifier base_class
{
... .. ...
}
class derived_class2: access_specifier base_class
{
... .. ...
}

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    Vehicle() { cout << "This is a Vehicle\n"; }
};

// first sub class
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    Car() { cout << "This Vehicle is Car\n"; }
};

// second sub class
class Bus : public Vehicle {
public:
    Bus() { cout << "This Vehicle is Bus\n"; }
};

// main function
int main()
{
    // Creating object of sub class will
    // invoke the constructor of base class.
    Car obj1;
    Bus obj2;
    return 0;
}
```

* Hybrid Inheritance-implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance. For example: Combining Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance will create hybrid inheritance in C++

There is no particular syntax of hybrid inheritance. We can just combine two of the above inheritance types.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    Vehicle() { cout << "This is a Vehicle\n"; }
};

// base class
class Fare {
public:
    Fare() { cout << "Fare of Vehicle\n"; }
};

// first sub class
class Car : public Vehicle {
  public:
  Car() { cout << "This Vehical is a Car\n"; }
};

// second sub class
class Bus : public Vehicle, public Fare {
  public:
  Bus() { cout << "This Vehicle is a Bus with Fare\n"; }
};

// main function
int main()
{
    // Creating object of sub class will
    // invoke the constructor of base class.
    Bus obj2;
    return 0;
}
```

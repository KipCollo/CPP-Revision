# Constants

When you do not want others (or yourself) to change existing variable values, use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

```cpp
const int myNum = 15;  // myNum will always be 15
myNum = 10;  // error: assignment of read-only variable 'myNum' 
```

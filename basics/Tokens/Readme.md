# Tokens

Tokens can be defined as the smallest building block of C++ programs that the compiler understands. Every word in a C++ source code can be considered a token

## Types of Tokens in C++

We have several types of tokens each of which serves a specific purpose in the syntax and semantics of C++. Below are the main types of tokens in C++:

1. Identifiers-are unique names given to entities(variables, functions, classes, or structs).
2. Keywords-are the tokens that are the reserved words in programming languages that have their specific meaning and functionalities within a program. Keywords cannot be used as an identifier to name any variables.
3. Constants-Are the tokens in C++ that are used to define variables at the time of initialization and the assigned value cannot be changed after that.
4. Strings-Is a class available in the STL library which provides the functionality to work with a sequence of characters, that represents a string of text.
5. Special Symbols-are the token characters having specific meanings within the syntax of the programming language. These symbols are used in a variety of functions, including ending the statements, defining control statements, separating items, and more.
6. Operators-are special symbols that are used to perform operations on operands such as variables, constants, or expressions.

### common special symbols used in C++ programming

* Semicolon (;): It is used to terminate the statement.
* Square brackets []: They are used to store array elements.
* Curly Braces {}: They are used to define blocks of code.
* Scope resolution (::): Scope resolution operator is used to access members of namespaces, classes, etc.
* Dot (.): Dot operator also called member access operator used to access class and struct members.
* Assignment operator ‘=’: This operator is used to assign values to variables.
* Double-quote (“): It is used to enclose string literals.
* Single-quote (‘): It is used to enclose character literals.

### Types of Operators

* Unary Operators
* Binary Operators
* Ternary Operators

### Rules to define the name of identifiers

1. An identifier can only begin with a letter or an underscore(_).
2. An identifier can consist of letters (A-Z or a-z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). White spaces and Special characters can not be used as the name of an identifier.
3. Keywords cannot be used as an identifier because they are reserved words to do specific tasks. For example, string, int, class, struct, etc.
4. Identifier must be unique in its namespace.
5. As C++ is a case-sensitive language so identifiers such as ‘first_name’ and ‘First_name’ are different entities.

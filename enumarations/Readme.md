# ENUMS

Enumerations (enums) in C++ are a user-defined data type that consists of integral constants. Enums are used to assign names to the integral constants, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Basic Syntax:

```cpp
enum EnumName {
    CONSTANT1,
    CONSTANT2,
    CONSTANT3,
    // ...
};
```
